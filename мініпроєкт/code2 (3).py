Improved Variable Naming:

Changed variable names for clarity (p to pay_per_visit, t to five_visit_total, and c to membership_cost).
Calculation of Leftover Visits:

Added leftover_visits = (v % 5) * 25 to account for any visits that donâ€™t fit into a 5-visit package, which ensures the calculation is accurate.
Simplified Conditionals:

The conditionals remain the same but are more readable with the new variable names.
